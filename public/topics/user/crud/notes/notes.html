        <h3>Forms and Validation</h3>
        <p>
            Controls (input, select, textarea) are ways for a user to enter data.
            A Form is a collection of controls for the purpose of grouping related controls together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Form and controls provide validation services, so that the user can be notified of invalid input before submitting a form.
            This provides a better user experience than server-side validation alone because the user gets instant feedback on how to correct the error.
            Keep in mind that while client-side validation plays an important role in providing good user experience,
            it can easily be circumvented and thus can not be trusted.
            Server-side validation is still necessary for a secure application.
