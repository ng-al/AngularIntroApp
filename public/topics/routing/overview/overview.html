        <h3>AngularJS Routing</h3>
        <p>
            One of the primary goals of the single-page approach is to provide the user with a more fluid, “desktop-like” experience.
            To that end, single-page apps attempt to reduce the total number of pages that a user must load down to one, hence their name.
            Whereas a traditional web application requires full page reloads (along with the accompanying URL change) as the user navigates from page to page,
            single-age apps shuttle all of this information over AJAX in the background.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, if the user’s URL isn’t going to change as they navigate around our app, how do we keep track of their location?
            This is the role of the router module in an AngularJS application.
            Currently, there are three routers to choose from:
            <ul>
                <li>angular-route</li>
                <li>angular-ui-router</li>
                <li>angular-new-router</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>angular-route</h4>
        <p>
            This is the router provided by the ngRoute module.  It is the routing engine used within this application.
            Refer to the accompanying tabs to see how it works.
        </p>

        <h4>angular-ui-router</h4>
        <p>
            UI-Router applications are modeled as a hierarchical tree of states.
            UI-Router provides a state machine to manage the transitions between those application states in a transaction-like manner.

        </p>

        <h4>angular-new-router</h4>
        <p>
            Javascript (and Javascript frameworks) are moving to a component model.
            With the new router, instead of routing to URIs like in ngRoute, or states in UI router, you navigate to components.
            Components can be arranged hierarchically, and each component manages it's own routing.
        </p>
        <p>
            This will be the standard router in AngularJS 2.0.
