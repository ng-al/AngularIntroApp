        <h3>Routing Configuration (with ngRoute)</h3>
        <p>
            When an AngularJS application starts; before directives and controllers referenced by the DOM are created,
            the Angular framework executes the configuration and run blocks for all of the modules.
        </p>
        <p>
            Configuration blocks are defined by <code>angular.module("myModuleName").config(...);</code>
            All of the configuration blocks (in all injected modules) are executed.
            The purpose of configuration blocks are to initialize application settings.
            Within a config block you can access value recipes and providers,
            but you do not have access to services since they are constructed during run time.
        </p>
        <p>
            ngRoute requires the application to define routing data using the <strong>$routeProvider</strong> during configuration time.
            The routing data is a mapping between URIs and their corresponding templates (and controllers).
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the page you are reading uses this declaration:
        </p>
        <code>
            $routeProvider<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.when("/routing/Config", {<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;templateUrl: "topics/routing/config/config.html"<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
        </code>
        <p>
            The source of the routing configuration can be found at <strong>/app/routing/routeConfig.js</strong>
        </p>
