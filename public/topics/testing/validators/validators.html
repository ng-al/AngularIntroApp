        <h3>Unit Testing Validators</h3>
        <p>
            Validators are directives.
            To test a validator first you need to build it as described in <a class="inline" href="#/testing/Directives">Testing/Directives</a>.
            However, since validators (ultimately) decide on the validity of model values,
            they utilize two controllers internal to AngularJS: the form controller, and the model controller.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of this, you need to include the validation directive on a <strong>named</strong>
            control within a <strong>named</strong> form. Naming the form will cause a property to be defined on the scope
            with that name. The value of this property will be the form controller.
        </p>
        <p>
            Naming the control will create a property (of the same name) to appear on the form controller object.
            This will be the model controller for that control element.
            Note that it is this model controller through which you will determine if the validator is working.
            The model controller's <strong>$valid</strong> property is set by AngularJS when your validator is executed.
        </p>

            var linkFn = $compile(formElement);<br />
            formElement = linkFn(formScope);<br /><br />

            var formController = formScope.form;<br />
            var modelController = formController.control;<br />
