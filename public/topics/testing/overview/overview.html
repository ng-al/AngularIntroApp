        <h3>AngularJS Uinit Testing</h3>
        <p>
            AngularJS was designed for unit testing.
            With AngularJS you can write code that ensures that your recipes function as desired.
            There are three aspects of AngularJS that not only make writing tests possible,
            but enable you to craft a suite of well designed unit tests.
        </p>

        <h4>SoC: Separation of Concerns</h4>
        <p>
            AngularJS provides a set of module recipe functions that encourage the architecture of a front-end application
            to be divided over a set of coordinated, simple parts.
            In this section, we will demonstrate how to create a unit test for each of the recipe types used in this sample app.
        </p>

        <h4>IoC: Dependency Injection</h4>
        <p>
            As you saw, AngularJS comes with dependency injection built-in, which makes creating the app and tests easy.
            Within the app, dependency injection allows you to build a sophisticated app by
            composing recipes that use other recipes via injection.
            With dependency injection, you do not describe what you are injecting based on it's location;
            you inject by name, with each name describing the functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you write a unit test, it is easy  control what injections of the recipe under test
            will be actual recipe parts or mocking objects.
        </p>

        <h4>ngMock</h4>
        <p>
            The ngMock module provides support to inject and mock Angular services into unit tests.
            In addition, ngMock also extends various core ng services such that they can be inspected and controlled
            in a synchronous manner within test code.

        <h4>Jasmine: The testing language</h4>
        <p>
            Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.
            It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks.
            It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

        <h4>Karma: The test runner for Javascript</h4>
        <p>
            Karma defines a productive testing environment to developers.
            The environment is simple to configure,
            and provides a place where developers can just write the code and get instant feedback from their tests.
            Quick feedback enables you to be productive and creative.
