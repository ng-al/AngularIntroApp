        <h3>Unit Testing Services</h3>
        <p>
            Getting the service (to test) is easy: You just inject it.
            However, to properly unit test a service, you must isolate it from the dependent services it injects.
            This is done via <strong>$httpBackend</strong> and mocking <a class="inline" href="#/testing/Mocking">Testing/Mocking</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>When not to Test</h4>
        <p>
            If all your service does is proxy server-side REST requests via <strong>$http</strong>, then there is <strong>NO</strong>
            need to test that service at all since there is no logic within the service to test.
            Services that contain logic (helper functions, utilities, etc.) should be tested.
        </p>
        <p>
            The unit test that is provided in this sample app is an example of a test that should not have been written.
            It is only here to demonstrate mocking a REST API via <strong>$httpBackend</strong>.
        </p>

        <h4>$httpBackend</h4>
        <p>
            When an Angular application needs some data from a server, it calls the <strong>$http</strong> service,
            which sends the request to a real server via the <strong>$httpBackend</strong> proxy.
            With dependency injection, you use the  <strong>$httpBackend</strong> service
            (from ngMock which has the same API as <strong>$httpBackend</strong>)
            and use it to verify the requests and respond with test data without making actual HTTP requests.
