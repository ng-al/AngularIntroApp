        <h3>Custom Validators</h3>
        <p>
            Custom validators in AngularJS are directives. They can be synchronous or asynchronous.
            Asynchronous validators are used when you need to call the server to perform the validation test.
            For example, in this application when adding or editing a user, we want the email to be unique.
            The only way to test this, is to ask the server to make this test via a database query.
        </p>

        <h4>Synchronous Validators</h4>
        <p>
            Within the <a class="inline" href="#routing/Dynamic">Routing/Dynamic</a> section, there is a validator
            (<strong>/topics/routing/dynamic/properUriValidator.js</strong>) that ensures that the typed in path begins with a slash
            and does not contain a hash.
        </p>

        <h4>Asynchronous Validators</h4>
        <p>
            Within the <a class="inline" href="#crud/Edit">CRUD/Edit</a> and
            <a class="inline" href="#crud/Add">CRUD/Add</a> sections, there is a validator
            (<strong>/topics/user/emailUniqueValidator.js</strong>) that ensures (via a server call) that two users do not
            have the same email address.
        </p>
